Zbik 0.0.1 - stable alpha

Python-based CLI for working with sequences. The current version is a stable alpha
that has the following implementations:

  -> Two main classes for ease of working: Alin (alignment) and Sequences.
  -> Sequences are loaded from  .fasta, .gb, and .gp files in a given directory into
     separate instances whose names correspond to their accession numbers
     with the loader() function. In case some accession numbers are the same
     (for instance in the demonstration or multiple versions of the same sequences
     without specified versions) instances names are modified by adding _v
     and the available number at the end of the instance name.
  -> Multiple sequences can be loaded directly into the Alin instance when
     the path is provided at instance declaration. Alin instance will detect
     sequence type conflicts and reacts accordingly.
  -> Determines the position at which point mutations occurred between
     multiple sequences. Displays them in human-readable form when
     Alin.show_point_mutations_positions() is called.
  -> Alin and Sequences have simple __str__ implemented.
  -> Determine the transition/transversion ratio for two sequences.
  -> Generate distance matrices for multiple sequences.
  -> Generates edit distances matrices for multiple sequences

Code-related info:
    The main block of the code is stored in alin.py. Some more refraction and simplification
    of that code will be done in the nearest future. Some attributes are static for now.
    They comment on the same line. Some implementation of DRY will be done soon to decrease
    the code size. CLI functionality is being gradually implemented. Nevertheless, the code
    will be functional as a form of library in the python shell.

The code was tested with Python 3.10.6. Using version below 3.10 will cause syntax errors.

More features, such as different types of alignment, will be implemented soon.
